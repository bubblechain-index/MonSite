        <h1>ðŸ“Š Proposed Business Model </h1>
        </header>
        
        <main>
        <p>My proposal is 0.25% management fees, with a breakdown like this;
        
        <p>âœ… 30% â†’ Index Coop</p>
        <p>âœ… 20% â†’ Community</p>
        <p>âœ… 20% â†’ Staking</p>
        <p>âœ… 25% â†’ Development</p>
        <p>âœ… 5% â†’ Creator</p>
        
        <p>The aim is to create a seamless collaboration model, where Index Coop brings its technical expertise and governance structure, while the community actively manages the evolution of ESG assets through a system of periodic votes.</p>
        <p>By keeping fees lower than the average ETF, we ensure maximum accessibility to investors while ensuring efficient and scalable management.</p>
        <h1>Additional fees, such as those related to staking or other incentive mechanisms, may be set and adjusted during community consensus. </h1>
        <h2>My role</h2>
        
        <h1>ðŸ”¹ Coordination </h1>
        
        <p>âœ… Propose and structure the vision of the ESG ETF to ensure its alignment with Index Coop's values and ESG principles.</p>
        <p>âœ… Participate in community discussions and votes to adapt the index to market changes.</p>
        <p>âœ… Facilitate communication between the different stakeholders (Coop Index, developers, DAO community).</p>
        
        <h1>ðŸ”¹ Strategic Development & Management</h1>
        
        <p>âœ… Ensure the proper functioning of the ESG model by proposing improvements and following updates to environmental and social criteria.</p>
        <p>âœ… Analyze crypto and ESG market trends to propose strategic changes.</p>
        <p>âœ… Organize exchanges with the DAO community to ensure active and transparent governance.</p>
        
        <h1>ðŸ”¹ Communication & Promotion</h1>
        
        <p>âœ… Develop educational and promotional content (articles, presentations, visuals) to draw attention to the ETF.</p>
        <p>âœ… Create marketing materials and visual montages to make the project easier to understand.</p>
        <p>âœ… Interact with the Index Coop community and investors to answer questions and ensure successful adoption.</p>

<strong>ðŸ“Œ My role is to serve as a bridge between the strategic vision and the technical implementation.

I am fully invested in the success of the project and ready to collaborate with Index Coop and the community to maximize its impact. ðŸŒŸ
